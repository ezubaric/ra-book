\chapter{Five Robot Apocalypses That Didn't Happen, And One That Did: Apocalypse One}


``Congratulations on the new job \dots which is \dots what, again?''

{\protag} and {\sidetag} {\lastname} sat on a cloth-covered sofa in the living room of their shared studio apartment. Both wore matching hoodies and worked on identical laptops. Nobody was ever surprised when they revealed that they were twins.

``An AI developer job at ReVOLTlution,'' {\protag} said. ``I start tomorrow.''

``Coding, ugh,” {\sidetag} said. ``Better you than me.''

``I doubt that,'' {\protag} said. ``You listen to cranks all day.''

``I listen to rich cranks all day for money,'' {\sidetag} corrected.

``Well, better you than me,'' {\protag} said. ``You know, \energyCompany{} has more openings if you’d like to apply. I bet they’d take you. I heard the CEO will hire anybody who passed a class taught by---'' and she named a notorious professor at the state university that she, {\sidetag}, and the company CEO had all attended.

``Nah, I'm good. Besides, they already have the smarter sibling. I'd hate to disappoint them.'' A screen came up on {\sidetag}’s computer. ``I have a client call in ten. Can I have the office?''

``Sure, I’m going over to the office to do some paperwork.''

{\protag} rode her bike to \energyCompany{}, which was on the industrial outskirts of \crunchyCity{}, a college town with a budding startup scene and a growing passion for clean energy.

Two years ago, the city had used eminent domain to purchase the local coal-fired power plant, then sold a pile of bonds to finance a smart grid for the entire municipality. Thanks to its geographical location---tucked between several mountain ranges---\crunchyCity{} conveniently experienced high winds just on its outskirts, which was perfect for an eight-turbine wind power plant that produced multiple gigawatts of power. Also conveniently, \crunchyCity{} was blessed with more sunny days than not, which made it one of the best cities in the United States for solar power.

Recently, \crunchyCity{}'s leadership decided to truly lean in to being a ``green city.'' Just in the past year, the city had begun to implement significant financial incentives to encourage its citizens to save energy. For instance, in exchange for a hefty reduction to the electricity bill, the city council installed free smart thermostats in willing customers' homes. These thermostats were connected by the internet to a municipal energy analysis application, which used data from the city's power grid and the weather to predict when those peak times would be. At peak times, the application sent out remote commands to shut off the air conditioning units of participating homes. People complained at first, but once they saw the huge deductions to their bills, they got on board. Within three years, more than 75\% of homes in \crunchyCity{} had these thermostats.

Happy with their first major success, the city council started to issue various incentives for homeowners to use more renewable energy. For instance, they decided to purchase electricity generated from homeowners' solar panels at market rates. But not too many homeowners signed on, because they found the energy market confusing and intimidating. And the homeowners old enough to remember Enron simply distrusted the markets.

Sensing an opportunity, several entreprenurial souls started \energyCompany{}, a smart solar panel company that boasted, among other things, algorithms to help consumers take advantage, legally, of the complex array of incentives and energy markets. But sales were slower than the company executives hoped for, because their panels were expensive.

So, \energyCompany{} decided that it needed a crack sales team. And because \energyCompany{} fancied itself on the bleeding edge of everything, they were not interested in traditional sales tactics. No, they wanted an artificial intelligence system to help human sales associates. (The \energyCompany{} CTO had even suggested making the Salesman do \emph{all} the sales, but the board had shot that down pretty quickly, citing the general public's fear of robots and artificial intelligence as evidenced in many clickbait headlines.) The CTO named the AI the Travelling Salesman after the famous theoretical computer science problem.

{\protag} was to be a junior developer on a coding team for the Salesman. In theory, the Salesman would help generate leads for human sales associates. Then, using demographic and other personal information on the leads, the Salesman would generate talking points and strategies for the human to execute. 

For {\protag}, who believed that robots ought to assist humans in tasks without supplanting them, it was an ideological fit.

For {\sidetag}, who provided hourly consultations to people who believed the AI apocalypse was imminent, it was a source of amusement and a lead on future income.

\sectionBreak{}

\energyCompany{} rented a small office in a business park near the mountains. True to \crunchyCity{} stereotype, there was a small contingent of nature freaks who went on hikes over extended lunch hours, and then worked again until later in the evening, after which they went rock climbing at a local gym. \energyCompany{} didn't have many standard startup perks but the office-purchased coffee was good and the ramen cupboard never ran low.

{\protag}'s team was competent and their project was even fun. Her job was to improve a part of the algorithm that analyzed successful salespeople's tactics. The algorithm then had to convert touchy-feeley human behaviors into data and turn the data around into a form that could be conveyed to another human. Ideally, the AI would also learn things like ``walks around to look at X, Y, Z'' or ``compliment the customer's flawless taste in interior decoration'' which were challenges {\protag} was happy to take on.

There was a cardboard cutout in the office--not of a robot, but of a generic office worker with its face cut out, leaving an empty oval space. The AI team's favorite joke was that their goal was to give even someone with the personality of cardboard the ability to make successful sales pitches.

At that moment though, the company still hired bubbly, confident, warm, and otherwise charismatic people to be their salespeople. Some of them even had coding experience.

{\protag} watched them in action as part of her job and worked on programming the Travelling Salesman to use the human salespeople’s behaviors as training data. Turning squishy human behaviors into data was as difficult as expected, and so, one day {\protag} accompanied their top sales associate to a sales pitch at a private residence.

It was a lovely home tucked away on the northern part of \crunchyCity{}, up a gentle slope of winding streets all named after mountainous flowers and trees. The houses were unique, luxurious, and beautifull designed. This potential client's house was seemingly constructed out of glass cubes, precariously overlooking a gorgeous view of dark pine trees and tiny mountain creeks.

{\protag} drove up the path with \energyJerk{} Green, a self described ``script kiddie turned honest salesman'' who was armed with a company smartphone on which the Travelling Salesman lived, and a Bluetooth set that delivered the Salesman's thoughts into his ear. They parked in a gravel driveway and walked up to the house, which featured a multicolored LED doorbell.

``This gadget is the latest model from--'' \energyJerk{} named an internet giant who was expanding quietly into various Internet of Things devices. ``This home is smarter than I am. Not that it's saying much.''

The door opened, preventing {\protag} from having to think up a polite response. The owner was a short thin man in his late fifties or early sixties, with scruffy gray hair and deeply tanned and wrinkled skin, wearing mud-splattered jeans with a frayed short-sleeved plaid button-down, no socks and no shoes. He carried a well-used tablet computer under one arm and held a stylus in his other hand.

It was hot outside, but a cool breeze emenated from the house. {\protag} heard the gentle hum of an expensive central air-conditioning setup inside.

``Come in," he said genially. "I was just working on my book here. It's a manifesto of sorts. I could use some conversation to shake some new concepts loose. What do you think will be the next game-changer in software development?"

``I'm not the person to answer that, Mr. Maris.'' \energyJerk{} gave a humble smile. ``My colleague here is our dev team superstar, so she's the one to ask. I'm just the guy who would like to show you some solar panel data.''

{\protag} wondered what the AI was whispering in\energyJerk{}'s ear. {\protag} had tested her code on a number of user personas but never personally tested it on an actual human.

``I'm always open to data,'' the man replied genially, and showed them in. They went through an arched hallway into a spacious living room bathed in sunlight. To their south, an alabaster stairway went skyward. They stopped at a huge oval teak table piled with papers and books, with mismatched chairs all around. Several photos in cheap plastic frames featured the owner with a woman--evidently his wife, as there were other photos featuring their children.

``Young lady, you read a bit and see what you think,'' Mr. Maris said, and placed his tablet in front of her. Thus politely exiled, {\protag} sat down obediently and started to read. The manifesto had fragments of intelligent thought on programming paradigms sprinkled through incoherent philosophical ramblings, and {\protag} spent more time thinking about how to better phrase his points than the points themselves.

``\dots could save you a lot of energy,'' a voice floated down from above. {\protag} idly noted the use of `energy' instead of `money'; it made sense that a homeowner like this would care more about virtue than the almighty dollar. ``It's going to hit 100 today, and the air conditioning \dots''

As he said that, {\protag} heard the sharp click of uninterruptible power source units flip and beep loudly, while the air conditioning turned off.

``\dots speak of the Devil. I'm sure it'll come back on soon, but just consider that with solar panels, you'd have a source of energy at the hottest times of the year. And the package includes a battery for home use, too, so it could be stored up to use later. You know, with the whole eminent domain thing, a lot of people are saying that the local utility isn't the most reliable thing \dots''

Sales tactics aside, {\protag} had seen that data and knew it was true. She tuned out and returned to the draft, and even had a few intelligent things to say nicely when \energyJerk{} came back down. It was not a surprise to her when, a day later, Mr. Maris called the company to say he was interested in their product.

It was a surprise to her when a month later, the CTO called the dev team in to say that an internet giant was interested in their company, particularly for their AI.

\sectionBreak{}

``Congratulations,'' {\sidetag} said, just over a year into {\protag}’s time at \energyCompany{}. ``A potential client blogged about you. You've made the big time.''

{\protag} was working from home that day because half of her team was at a sales show. It was a terribly hot Friday in August. A blackout had hit \crunchyCity{} at noon, leaving the entire city to swelter and {\protag} to miss the beginning of \energyCompany{}'s daily stand-up meeting.

At {\sidetag}'s remark, {\protag} leaned over to check out the webpage displayed on {\sidetag}'s computer. There it was, a 5,000-word blog post declaring \energyCompany{} to be the ``Harbinger of the Robot Apocalypse.''

``He wants to make this a blog series,'' said {\sidetag}. ``I quoted him a hundred an hour. I think he'll do it.''

{\protag} had a deadline but couldn't resist this piece of temptation. {\sidetag} handed her the laptop.

``THE ROBOTS ARE READING YOUR MIND TO PICK YOUR POCKET!'' read the subject line. It escalated from there. ``\energyCompany{}'s new `Travelling Salesman' is supposedly the best sales AI in existence, resulting in record sales conversions of their overpriced solar panels! What can this be but using machines to READ OUR MINDS and manipulate us? Soon we will be in FINANCIAL SLAVERY to the companies that can zap our brains to make us BUY, BUY BUY!''

``Wow,'' {\protag} finally said, not knowing how else to react.

``He's actually one of my more coherant clients,'' {\sidetag} said thoughtfully. ``I might give him a discount on this series. Good for business.''

``I can't believe this,'' {\protag} said.

``I looked into the data that he provided,'' {\sidetag} said. ``According to trade association reports, \energyCompany{}'s sales are shattering industry records, even though they laid off most of their sales staff. Do you think those numbers are fake?''

{\protag} thought about the slide deck she was supposed to be working on. ``No. We’ve been doing well.''

While {\protag} didn’t exactly get to look over accounting's shoulder, she could tell from the good mood in the company, and her first-ever annual bonus, that they were doing well financially.

Sales had indeed laid off many of its human staff (\energyJerk{} stayed on) and, instead, started a pilot program of hiring part-time gig workers (\energyJerk{} trained them). Judging from how much complaining came out of the manufacturing side of the business, they were getting more orders than they could handle. The panels were good products, as were the smart features that gave customers money back. Satisfaction was high. Although the internet giant lost interest, that almost did not matter: the company focused on growing itself. \energyCompany{} had expanded out of \crunchyCity{} and started campaigns targeting other nearby cities.

Given those results, it was only reasonable to conclude that the Travelling Salesman was doing something right. Heck, {\protag} thought, maybe she should borrow the Salesman herself. It might convince her landlord to buy solar panels from somebody, if not \energyCompany{}. That would probably be a conflict of interest.

{\protag} was spared from her musings when the power came back on. She put on her headset and called into the meeting, which was half over.

``---and just so you all know, sales closed five more deals yesterday. Let's have a round of applause!''

The air conditioning started back up just then. The blast of cool air hit {\protag}'s face like a slap, waking her up to reality.

Her work was good. But it could not possibly be that good, simply because the field of AI was not yet that good. The Salesman could not possibly be getting those results on its own.

Yet the sales numbers were real. Customers reported high rates of satisfaction with the product, although they did often complain about the prices.

Was the AI a fake? {\protag} had heard of several cases where an ``AI'' was actually a glorified crowd of low-paid workers. But {\protag} had seen the Salesman's code. It trained on human data and let a human make the final decision on what to say, but there was no room for humans to interfere between those two steps. Besides, few humans could match the staggering success rate that the Salesman had. It was unlikely that \energyCompany{} had somehow hired an army of such skilled salespeople.

Still, {\protag} thought that something smelled off about the whole thing.

She went to sleep early and, Saturday morning, logged onto the servers. Staring at folders full of code and logs and documentation, {\protag} realized she had no idea where to start.  She sat there paralyzed for about ten minutes before she realized that she could simply test the Salesman. Although {\protag} had coded a big chunk of its code, she had never tried to use the final product as a whole. Maybe doing so would provide either inspiration or directions on her next steps.

It was the work of only a few minutes to compile the Salesman on her laptop and install the app on her personal smartphone. She loaded {\sidetag}'s name into the app. The interface brought up a slow swirl of calming colors while it processed her request. When the app told {\protag} that it was ready to get started, she put the phone on speaker and set the app to begin its sales pitch. A cartoony happy face popped onto the screen and began to talk.

``I have some information for you!'' The Salesman had a chipper voice that sounded like a sports announcer. {\protag} wondered if there were options for different personas. ``Don't worry, I'll remind you later, but let's have an overview! Your target is {\sidetag} Hobbes. Age 23. He is a self-employed white male with a STEM degree from a top 25 university in his field. No criminal history. Significant internet presence with interest heavily concentrated in \dots'' and it went on for a while. None of it was surprising to {\protag}, but she imagined it would shock some people to know that so much personal information was freely available online, and plenty more existed if you were willing to pay for it.

When the dossier ended, the Salesman chimed.

``Wait thirty seconds while I do the thing,'' the Salesman said, still inhumanly chipper, and the smiley face actually winked. {\protag} knew this wasn't in the default behavior. But then again, the whole point of the Salesman was that it was highly flexible to accomodate a wide range of human customers.

One-one thousand, two-one thousand \dots the time was up, and nothing happened. She frowned. 

{\sidetag} walked into the room, holding up his buzzing phone. ``We've got a hacker.''

{\protag} was simultaneously annoyed by the interruption and troubled by the announcement. ``Excuse me?''

``Someone’s targeting our Internet of Things network. I set up an alert system last year after a blogger paid me with that fancy remote controlled espresso machine. Its app was super insecure. I always knew that someday, someone would go after the system.''

``Are you seriously telling me that a hacker is targeting your espresso?''

``No. You know those fancy free programmable smart thermostats that \crunchyCity{} got our landlord to install? I've always thought those things were dangerous. Someone just proved me right.''

``Why would someone try to mess with our thermostats?''

``Well, if you believe my customers, cyberterrorist attacks are imminent and we should all be wearing tinfoil hats while living underground. But if you ask me---''

The lights went off with a snap at the same instant that {\protag}'s back pocket buzzed.

``Done! Now it's time to move onto the next part of the sales pitch. Point out the weakness of the city’s electric grid and say this wouldn't happen if he had solar panels.''

{\protag} dropped the phone.

``Oh no," she said. ``I’m the hacker.''

``Really?'' {\sidetag} frowned. ``I expected better work from you. This is disappointing.''

``I mean, my AI is,'' {\protag} amended. ``That’s how it boosting sales. It's been breaking people’s thermostat systems to motivate them to buy panels.''

``You think an AI is actually capable of being evil? Do \emph{you} want to come be on my podcast?''

``Stop it, {\sidetag}. The AI isn't evil. It's naive. Like a little kid. It learns from whoever uses it. And \energyJerk{} `taught' it all his tricks. I saw the lights go off when I was at a client's house with him. He must have done something shady there.''

``Well,” {\sidetag} said. ``Let's figure out exactly what is going on before you go around accusing anyone.''

It was the work of the weekend to work out what exactly the Travelling Salesman was doing.

It seemed that \energyJerk{} had not left his coding days behind after all. On certain sales calls, he used various hacking programs that lived on his phone---the same phone that his copy of the Salesman lived on---to compromise smart thermostats or other Internet of Things devices. This allowed him to overload customers' circuits and trigger blackouts at will. Customers, thus reminded of the unreliability of the city grid, were influenced to buy solar panels.

At some point the Salesman had picked up on \energyJerk{}'s hacking. It was, after all, trained to replicate his actions without regard for anything other than increasing the sales success rate. The app was able to access the same programs and give the same commands that \energyJerk{} did, and found it wildly successful.

{\protag} covered her face, horrified and impressed at the same time.

{\sidetag} said, ``What are you going to do?''

\sectionBreak{}

Her opportunity came earlier than expected.

Every fall, the company flew in its board of advisors for an annual meeting, complete with slide presentations and a fancy catered dinner. {\protag} glanced at the proposed schedule and saw a very obvious lack of a demonstration of the Salesman. That figured. {\protag} didn't think \energyJerk{} was eager to show off his tricks. The first meeting of the day was about finances. After that, the mid-morning's talks mostly revolved around methods of manufacturing solar panels while the afternoon's talks were about energy policies.

The engineer who enjoyed giving a talk had yet to be born, so {\protag} met only perfunctory resistance when she offered, in her weekly meeting with her line manager, \Boss{}, to give a lunchtime slide deck on the Travelling Salesman AI. \Boss{} offered to review {\protag}'s slide but seemed quite relieved when she declined.

Everyone piled into the conference room at noon on the fateful day. Two office interns passed out boxed salads while Susan, sweating in her new suit, set up her laptop. The background chatter quieted when her title slide flashed onto the screen: ``The Travelling Salesman: How Does It Work?''

{\protag} went to the second slide, which was a screenshot of many lines of code. She saw eyes immediately glaze over. Perfect.

``This is boring, am I right?'' {\protag} said. The audience perked up. ``Reading raw code is really boring, even for programmers. What's interesting is what the code does. And our code? It learns. Specifically, it learns to sell things from humans. In our case, it has learned from the best sales associate alive---\energyJerk{}! Can you come up here?''

{\protag} flashed a slide showing sales numbers growing along with how much the AI showed it had learned from \energyJerk{}. He did come up, bashfully. Applause rang out and he smiled at the audience. {\protag} positioned herself between him and the exit.

``So you see,'' {\protag} said. ``There's no need to be afraid of any robot overlords, because they are really only us humans, just a bit more effective.''

A few knowing nods in the audience.

{\protag} picked up her phone and set the slide to display her device. She pressed the app and launched it.

``So of course, what is important is for us to learn just how we humans can be more effective.''

\Boss{} was raising his eyebrows in the audience. This hadn't been in {\protag}'s slide deck.

``And so, I thought the best result would be what the Salesman AI can do for a completely hopeless sales agent. I once failed to sell bottled water. At the beach. In July.'' Laughter. ``So I'm going to try to sell solar panels to you all, with the help of the Travelling Salesman, which \energyJerk{} trained.''

Cheers erupted.

``Normally I would be wearing a headset, but for the demo, I'm going to put my phone on speaker.'''

\energyJerk{} blanched. {\protag} tried to stay nonchalant. While everyone watched, she put the URL for \energyJerk{}'s LinkedIn profile into the AI interface.

``I have some information for you before going on your call! Your target is \energyJerk{} Smith. Age 25. He is an employed white male with a degree in psychology \dots''

The AI cheerily spat out its usual insights. {\protag} noticed none of them. Her hands were sweaty and shaking and she was terribly warm under the lights.

``Wait for me to do the thing!''

Coffemakers shorted out, window control units overloaded, the air conditioning units screamed like banshees. Then the power went out, and with it the presentation slides.

{\protag} said, with theatrical obliviousness, ``What just happened there?''

She was a terrible actor and would not have fooled anyone---had anyone been paying attention to her. But it was chaos in the office. People looked around asking what had gone wrong. In the confusion, \energyJerk{} made an attempt to bolt. {\protag}, finished with subtlety, stuck out a foot. Over the thump of \energyJerk{}'s face meeting the floor, {\protag} met her boss's gaze.

``Excuse us,'' \Boss{} choked out, drawing herself up. ``My team needs to check on something.''

\sectionBreak{}

``That could have gone better,'' {\sidetag} said.

``Laugh it up,'' said a newly unemployed {\protag}. ``You're going to have to cover the rent until I find something new.''

``Worth it,'' {\sidetag} said.

After the confusion died down, everyone at \energyCompany{} had eventually understood exactly what happened and who was responsible. However, that didn't stop the media from gleefully trumpeting the story from every major publication in the United States, and a handful worldwide. The damage was done. {\protag}'s unit was shut down and almost everyone was shown the door. Half of the staff thought {\protag} was a hero while the other half reviled her for ruining a good thing. {\protag}, for her part, was glad to be out of there.

But she was going to need a paycheck, and soon.

``You know what,'' {\protag} said, ``maybe you have the right idea.''

``Of course I do. What idea?''

``Using my expertise to work on projects that I can control and nobody else can muck up for me,'' {\protag} said.

``Okay,'' {\sidetag} said cautiously, ``what does that mean?''

``I think I'll become a consultant, just like you.''
