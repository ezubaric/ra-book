\chapter{Story One: Hello Bayder}


``Congratulations on the new job ... which is ... what, again?''

{\protag} and {\sidetag} {\lastname} sat on a cloth-covered sofa in the living room of their shared studio apartment. Both wore matching hoodies and worked on identical laptops. Nobody was ever surprised when they revealed that they were twins.

``An AI developer job at ReVOLTlution,'' {\protag} said. ``I start tomorrow.''

``Coding, ugh,” {\sidetag} said. ``Better you than me.''

``I doubt that,'' {\protag} said. ``You listen to cranks all day.''

``I listen to rich cranks all day for money,'' {\sidetag} corrected.

``Well, better you than me,'' {\protag} said. ``You know, ReVOLTlution has more openings if you’d like to apply. I bet they’d take you. I heard the CEO will hire anybody who passed a class taught by---'' and she named a notorious professor at the state university that she, {\sidetag}, and the company CEO had all attended.

``Nah, I'm good. Besides, they already have the smarter sibling. I'd hate to disappoint them.'' A screen came up on {\sidetag}’s computer. ``I have a client call in ten.''

``Okay, I’m going over to the office to do some paperwork.''

{\protag} rode her bike to ReVOLTlution, which was on the industrial outskirts of Bayder, a college town with a budding startup scene and a passion for clean energy. Two years ago, the city had used eminent domain to purchase the local coal-fired power plant, then sold a pile of bonds to finance a smart grid for the entire municipality. Thanks to its geographical location---tucked between several mountain ranges---Bayder experienced high winds just on its outskirts, which was perfect for an eight-turbine wind power plant that produced multiple gigawatts of power. Finally, Bayder was also blessed with more sunny days than not, which made it a prime city for solar power. Thanks to discounts and other incentives, solar panels were a fixture of many, but not all, rooftops in Bayder.

Bayder's citizens and leadership wanted even more energy savings, however. In the past year, the city decided to encourage people to use less power during peak times, for instance, hot summer afternoons. In exchange for a hefty reduction to the electricity bill, the council installed free programmable thermostats that were connected to a municipal controller, which looked at the city's power grid and the weather to predict when those peak times would be---and then shut off the air conditioning units of participating homes. People complained, but they complained a lot less when they received their rebates.

Enter ReVOLTlution, a hip new solar panel company, to take advantage of this incentive and to help consumers do the same. The panels practically sold themselves.

But not everyone bought in, because solar panels were expensive--more expensive than doing nothing, anyway. And because ReVOLTlution fancied itself on the bleeding edge of everything, they were not interested in traditional sales tactics. No, they wanted an AI in sales. It was named, of course, the Travelling Salesman.

{\protag} was to join a young coding team producing artificial intelligence software that helped generate leads for human sales associates, and then using information on the leads, helped generate talking points and strategies for the human to execute.

For {\protag}, who believed that robots ought to serve humans, it was an ideological fit.

For {\sidetag}, who provided hourly consultations to people who believed the AI apocalypse was imminent, it was a source of amusement and a lead on possible future income.

\vspace{5mm}

ReVOLTlution rented a small office in a business park near the mountains. True to Bayder stereotype, there was a small contingent of nature freaks who went on hikes over extended lunch hours, and then worked again until later in the evening, after which they went rock climbing at a local gym. ReVOLTlution didn't have many standard startup perks but the office-purchased coffee was good and the ramen cupboard never ran low.

{\protag}’s team was competent and the project was even fun. Her job was to improve a part of the algorithm that analyzed successful salespeople's tactics and had to somehow take the amorphous concept of human behaviors, convert them into data, and turn that into a form that could be conveyed to another human. Ideally the AI would also learn things like ``walks around to look at X, Y, Z'' or ``compliment the customer's flawless taste in interior decoration'' which were challenges {\protag} was happy to take on.

There was a cardboard cutout in the office--not of a robot, but of a generic office worker with its face cut out, leaving an empty oval space. The AI team's favorite joke was that their goal was to give even someone with the personality of cardboard the ability to make successful sales pitches.

At that moment though, tellingly, the company still hired bubbly, confident, warm, and otherwise charismatic people to be their salespeople. Some of them even had coding experience.

{\protag} watched them in action as part of her job and worked on programming the Travelling Salesman to use the human salespeople’s behaviors as training data. Turning squishy human behaviors into data was as difficult as expected, and so, one day {\protag} accompanied their top sales associate to a sales pitch at a private residence.

It was a lovely home tucked away on the northern part of Bayder, up a gentle slope of winding streets all named after mountainous flowers and trees. The houses were to a one unique and luxurious, but most of all they were shockingly tasteful. This potential client's house was seemingly constructed out of glass cubes, precariously overlooking a gorgeous view of dark pine trees and tiny mountain creeks.

{\protag} drove up the path with Canyon Green, a self described ``script kiddie turned honest salesman'' who was armed with a company smartphone on which the Travelling Salesman lived, and a Bluetooth set that delivered the Salesman's thoughts into his ear. They parked in a gravel driveway and walked up to the house, which featured a multicolored LED doorbell.

``This gadget is the latest model from--'' Canyon named an internet giant who was expanding quietly into various Internet of Things devices. ``This home is smarter than I am. Not that it's saying much.''

The door opened, preventing {\protag} from having to think up a polite response. The owner was a short thin man in his late fifties or early sixties, with scruffy gray hair and deeply tanned and wrinkled skin, wearing mud-splattered jeans with a frayed short-sleeved plaid button-down, no socks and no shoes. He carried a well-used tablet computer under one arm and held a stylus in his other hand.

It was hot outside, but it was cool indoors--not too cool, but a comfortable temperature that was being achieved without any arctic blasts through the vents. There was a fan, but it was a gentle white noise instead of an overwhelming whine. In short, it felt expensively soothing. {\protag} decided to enjoy it.

``Come in," he said genially. "I was just working on my book here. It's a manifesto of sorts. I could use some conversation to shake some new concepts loose. What do you think will be the next game-changer in software development?"

``I'm not the person to answer that, Mr. Maris.'' Canyon gave a smile. ``My colleague here is our dev team superstar, so she's the one to ask,'' he said humbly. ``I'm just the guy who would like to show you some solar panel data.''

What was the AI whispering in his ear? {\protag} had written the code and run it on a number of people, but hadn't been given the information about Mr. Rich Lumberjack.

``I'm always open to data,'' the man replied genially, and showed them in. They went through an arched hallway into a spacious living room bathed in sunlight. To their south, an alabaster stairway went skyward. They stopped at a huge oval teak table piled with papers and books, with mismatched chairs all around. Several photos in cheap plastic frames featured the owner with a woman--evidently his wife, as there were other photos featuring their children.

``Young lady, you read a bit and see what you think,'' Mr. Maris said, and placed his tablet in front of her. Thus politely exiled, {\protag} sat down obediently and started to read. The manifesto had fragments of intelligent thought on programming paradigms sprinkled through incoherent philosophical ramblings, and {\protag} spent more time thinking about how to better phrase his points than the points themselves.

``... could save you a lot of energy,'' a voice floated down from above. {\protag} idly noted the use of `energy' instead of `money'; it made sense that a homeowner like this would care more about virtue than the almighty dollar. ``It's going to hit 100 today, and the air conditioning ...''

As he said that, {\protag} heard the sharp click of uninterruptible power source units flip and beep loudly, while the air conditioning turned off.

``... speak of the Devil. I'm sure it'll come back on soon, but just consider that with solar panels, you'd have a source of energy at the hottest times of the year. And the package includes a battery for home use, too, so it could be stored up to use later. You know, with the whole eminent domain thing, a lot of people are saying that the local utility isn't the most reliable thing ...''

Sales tactics aside, {\protag} had seen that data and knew it was true. She tuned out and returned to the draft, and even had a few intelligent things to say nicely when Canyon came back down. It was not a surprise to her when, a day later, Mr. Maris called the company to say he was interested in their product.

It was a surprise to her when a month later, the CTO called the dev team in to say that an internet giant was interested in their company, particularly for their AI.

\vspace{5mm}

``Congratulations,'' {\sidetag} said, just over a year into {\protag}’s time at ReVOLTlution. ``A potential client blogged about you. You've made the big time.''

{\protag} was working from home that day because half of her team was at a sales show. It was a terribly hot August day but to save on the electricity bill, she and {\sidetag} usually set the air conditioner at a high threshold and draped themselves with wet towels and set standing fans on high.

Today they had intended to treat themselves to a little more comfort, but a blackout had hit Bayder at noon, leaving the entire city to swelter and {\protag} to worry about calling in to the stand-up meeting at three.

At {\sidetag}'s remark, {\protag} leaned over to check out the webpage displayed on {\sidetag}'s computer. There it was, a 5,000-word blog post declaring ReVOLTlution to be the Harbinger of the Robot Apocalypse.

``He wants to make this a series,'' said {\sidetag}. ``I quoted him a hundred an hour. I think he'll do it.''

{\protag} had a deadline but couldn't resist this piece of temptation. {\sidetag} handed her the laptop.

``THE ROBOTS ARE READING YOUR MIND TO PICK YOUR POCKET!'' read the subject line. It escalated from there. ``ReVOLTlution's new `Travelling Salesman' is supposedly the best sales AI in existence, resulting in record sales conversions of their overpriced solar panels! What can this be but using machines to READ OUR MINDS and manipulate us? Soon we will be in FINANCIAL SLAVERY to the companies that can zap our brains to make us BUY, BUY BUY!''

``Wow,'' {\protag} finally said, not knowing how else to react.

``He's actually one of my more coherant clients,'' {\sidetag} said thoughtfully. ``I might give him a discount. Could be a repeat customer.''

``I can't believe this,'' {\protag} said.

``I looked into the data that he provided,'' {\sidetag} said. ``According to trade association reports, ReVOLTlution's sales are shattering industry records, even though they laid off most of their sales staff. Do you think those numbers are fake?''

{\protag} thought about the slide deck she was supposed to be working on. ``No. We’ve been doing well.''

While {\protag} didn’t exactly get to look over accounting's shoulder, she could tell from the good mood in the company, and her first-ever annual bonus, that they were doing well financially.

Sales had indeed laid off many of its human staff (Canyon stayed on) and, instead, started a pilot program of hiring part-time gig workers (Canyon trained them). Judging from how much complaining came out of the manufacturing side of the business, they were getting more orders than they could handle. The panels were good products, as was the smart panel features that gave customers money back. Customer satisfaction was high. Although the internet giant lost interest, that almost did not matter: the company focused on growing itself. ReVOLTlution had expanded out of Bayder, and indeed had started campaigns targeting other nearby cities.

Which was to say, the Travelling Salesman was doing something right.

``Well then, maybe I should borrow the Salesman. Maybe it can convince our landlord to do something about this,'' {\protag} said, waving a hand at the still, hot air. ``The sun is blinding outside. Solar panels should sell themselves in this heat with blackouts. I wouldn't need a sales AI to do it. But hm. It would be a conflict of interest. Do you think i could drop a flyer from a competitor into the management mailbox?''

The power came back on just then. {\protag} grabbed her headset to call in.

Just in time to hear that sales had closed five more sales that day.

As the blast of cool air hit her face, it felt like a slap from reality.

Her work was good. But it wasn't that good. She believed that the sales were real. So were the panels; {\protag} did think they were a bit overpriced but they weren't getting complaints or returns. But something ... something ... didn't smell right about the whole thing.

{\protag} logged into the work server extra early the next day, before any other developers had probably woken up yet.

Staring at folders full of code and logs and documentation, {\protag} realized she had no idea where to start. 

She sat there paralyzed for about ten minutes before she realized that she could simply test the AI first, which would then suggest directions for further investigation--if needed.

It was the work of only a few minutes to install the app on her personal smartphone. Then she called in sick and logged out.

She loaded {\sidetag}'s name and information into the app and watched its calm swirling colors while it thought, complete with a thinking-face emoji. She put the app on speaker and told it to get started.

{\protag} had watched demos before, before the app actually went into the field. There had been improvements since. The UX developer had found a chipper male voice to replace the robotic drone of earlier days, and added more audio cues as to what the AI was doing while it was processing.

``I have some information for you before going on your call!'' The Salesman chirped. ``Don't worry, I'll remind you later, but let's have an overview! Your target is {\sidetag} Hobbes. Age 23. He is a self-employed white male with a STEM degree from a top 25 university in his field. No criminal history. Significant internet presence with interest heavily concentrated in ...'' and it went on for a while. None of it was surprising to {\protag}, but she imagined it would shock their parents that so much information was freely available online, and more if you were willing to pay for it.

When the dossier ended, the Salesman chimed.

``Wait thirty seconds while I do the thing,'' the Salesman said, still inhumanly chipper, and his animated face actually winked. {\protag} knew this wasn't in the default behavior. Interesting.

One-one thousand, two-one thousand ... the time was up, and nothing happened. She frowned. 

{\sidetag} walked into the room, his phone buzzing. ``We’ve got a hacker,'' he said, frowning.

``Excuse me?''

``Someone’s targeting our IoT network. I set up an alert system last year, after I got paid in that fancy remote controlled espresso machine that had the phone app. I always knew that someday, someone would go after the system.''

``Are you seriously telling me that a hacker is targeting your espresso?''

``No. You know those fancy new regulators that Bayder got all the landlords to install? I’ve always thought those things were dangerous. Someone just proved me right. I don’t know what they tried to do exactly yet, but someone definitely just tried to access our unit. I’m not really sure why they’d want to hit our energy meters, but--''

The lights went off. {\protag}'s back pocket buzzed.

``Done! Now it's time to move onto the next part of the sales pitch. Point out the weakness of the city’s electric grid and say this wouldn't happen if he had solar panels.''

{\protag} dropped the phone.

``Oh god," she said. ``I’m the hacker.''

``Really?'' {\sidetag} frowned. ``If so, I expected better from you. This is disappointing.''

``I mean, my AI is,'' {\protag} amended. ``That’s how it boosting sales. It's been breaking people’s electricity to motivate them to buy panels.''

``You think it’s actually evil? Do \emph{you} want to comebe on my podcast?''

``Stop it, {\sidetag}. The AI isn't evil. It's naive. Like a little kid. It learns from whoever uses it. And Canyon `taught' it all his tricks. I saw the lights go off when I was at a client’s house with him. He must have done something shady there.''

``Hey,” {\sidetag} said. ``Let’s figure out exactly what is going on before you go around accusing anyone.''

It was the work of the weekend to work out what exactly the Travelling Salesman was doing.

[Jordan’s explanation goes here]

{\sidetag} said, ``What are you going to do?''

\vspace{5mm}

Her opportunity came earlier than expected.

Every year the company flew in its board of advisors for an annual meeting, complete with slide presentations and a catered dinner with steak, seafood, and vegan options. {\protag} glanced at the proposed schedule and saw a very obvious lack of a demonstration of the AI. That figured. {\protag} didn't think Canyon was eager to show off his tricks, and he didn't know enough about programming to reset the AI's behavior. Besides, the company's revenue stream was mostly about solar panels, and the day's technical talks thus revolved around photochemistry and materials science.

The engineer who enjoyed giving a talk had yet to be born, so {\protag} met only perfunctory resistance when she offered, in her weekly meeting with her boss, to give a slide deck on the Travelling Salesman AI. The lead developer only reviewed her slides for accuracy before clearing her.

The board showed up on the dot that morning.

{\protag} was slated for the end of the standup.

{\protag} was sweating through her suiting all day as she tried to actually go about her work. Maybe it had been a mistake to wear wool in May. She was an amateur at this game.

At standup, the board listened respectfully as the teams went through their tasks, blocks, and suggestions.

And then {\protag} was called to give her talk.

She flashed the title slide, then the second, and then stopped.

``This is boring, am I right?'' {\protag} said. ``Reading raw code is boring, even to coders. What's interesting is what the code does. And it learns. It learns to sell things--thought of as a human trait--from humans. In our case it has learned from the best sales associate alive--Canyon! Can you come up here?''

{\protag} flashed a slide showing sales numbers growing along with how much the AI showed it had learned from Canyon. He did come up, bashfully. Applause rang out and he smiled at the audience.

``So you see,'' {\protag} said. ``There's no need to be afraid of any robot overlords, because they are really only us humans, only more effective.''

A few knowing nods in the audience.

{\protag} picked up her phone and set the slide to display her device. She pressed the app and launched it.

``So of course, what is important is for us to learn just how we humans can be more effective.''

Travis was raising his eyebrows in the audience. This hadn't been in {\protag}'s slide deck.

``And so, I thought the best result would be what the AI can do for a completely hopeless sales agent. I once failed to sell bottled water. At the beach. In July.'' Laughter. ``So I'm going to try to sell solar panels to you all, with the help of--in AI form--Canyon's tips and tricks.''

Cheers erupted.

``Normally I would be wearing a headset, but for the demo, I'm going to put my phone on speaker.'''

Canyon blanched. {\protag} tried to look oblivious. While everyone watched, she put the URL for Canyon's LinkedIn profile into the AI interface.

``I have some information for you before going on your call! Your target is Canyon Smith. Age 25. He is an employed white male with a degree in psychology ...''

The AI spat out some insights. {\protag} noticed none of them. Her hands were sweaty and shaking and she was terribly warm under the lights.

``Wait for me to do the thing!''

Coffemakers shorted out, window control units overloaded, the air conditioning units screamed like banshees. Then the power went out, and with it the slides.

{\protag} said, ``What just happened there?''

Canyon, as expected, made an attempt to bolt. {\protag}, finished with subtlety, stuck out a foot. Over the thump of Canyon's face meeting the floor, {\protag}'s eyes met Travis'.

``Excuse us,'' the lead developer choked out, drawing himself up. ``My team needs to check on something.''

\vspace{5mm}

``That could have gone better,'' {\sidetag} said.

``Laugh it up,'' said a newly unemployed {\protag}. ``You're going to have to cover the rent until I find something new.''

``Worth it,'' {\sidetag} said.

Everyone had understood exactly what happened and who was responsible. That didn't stop the media from gleefully trumpeting the story from every major publication in the US, and a handful elsewhere. The damage was done before anyone could do a thing. Their unit was shut down and the vast majority of staff shown the door.

``Glad you think so,'' {\protag} said. ``You know what, maybe you have the right idea.''

``Of course I do. What idea?''

``Using my expertise to work on projects that I can control and nobody else can muck up for me,'' {\protag} said. ``I think I'll become a consultant.''
