\chapter{AI can be Jerks: Learning from the Best}

The previous story saw our protagonist start her carrer, and our essays will begin with foundational material.  What a lay user needs to understand what's happening in the story and how realistic it is.  We'll save the more fanciful and complicated stuff for later chapters.  

We first introduce a key component of machine learning---objective functions---that define why systems act they way they do. We then show how bad human behavior can be mimicked by these algorithms (it's already happening!).  Finally, we close the chapter with a call to action: keep your computers safe!
